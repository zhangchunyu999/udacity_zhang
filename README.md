# Udacity_self_driving_car

This repository contains the notes and project file about Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program, which I started on 10 July, 2019. This is a online course for learning the technology and programing of autonomouse driving system. The program is developed by Udacity in partnership with Mercedes-Benz, NVIDIA,etc.

# Program Outline:

## Term 1: Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Sensor Fusion

### Project 1: Finding Lane Lines(Computer Vision) 
   
**Summary**: Detect the lane of highway from a video. Used OpencV image techniques suck as Hough Transforms and Canny edge detection etc.
   
**Solution**: Python

### Project 2: Advanced Lane Finding(Computer Vision) 
   
**Summary**: Detect the lane of highway from a video with camera calibration, color transfroms, and sliding window etc.
   
**Solution**: Python

### Project 3: Traffic Sign Classifier(Deep Learning)
   
**Summary**: Build a CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks) to determine the traffic sign from the German Traffic Sign Dataset.
   
**Solution**: Python, TensorFlow

### Project 4: Behavioural Cloning(Deep Learning)

**Summary**: Build and train a CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks) with the library of Keras to control the car can run around the track.
   
**Solution**: Python, Keras

### Project 5: Extended Kalman Filters(Sensor Fusion)

**Summary**: Write kalman filters with C++. Use the sensor fusion of LiDAR and RADAR measurement to estimate the position.
   
**Solution**: C++

## Term 2: Localization, Path Planning, Control, and System Integration

### Project 6: Kidnapped Vehicle (Localisation)

**Summary**: Use particle filters to locate a car relative to the world. 
   
**Solution**: C++

### Project 7: Highway Driving(Path Planning)

**Summary**: With the sensor fusion data make the car running on the highway, set the requirement such as speed, acceleration, jerk, the safety distance to oter cars, and on. Make sure the car can smooth and safe run on the track.
   
**Solution**: C++

### Project 8: PID Controller(Control)

**Summary**: Write a controller of PID with C++. Make sure the car could run around the track, but no tire may leave the drivable portion of the track surface.
   
**Solution**: C++

### Final Project: Program an Autonomous Vehicle

**Summary**: Complete the simulation make sure the car can run around the track, and then put your code in a real self-driving car
