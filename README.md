# Udacity_self_driving_car

This repository contains notes and project files for the Udacity Autonomous Car Engineer Nanodegree program launched on July 10, 2019. This is an online course to learn the technology and programming of autonomous driving systems. This program is being developed by Udacity in collaboration with Mercedes-Benz, NVIDIA and others.

# Program Outline:

## Term 1: Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Sensor Fusion

### Project 1: Finding Lane Lines(Computer Vision) 
   
**Summary**: Detect highway lanes from video. The OpencV image technology used functions such as Hough transform and Canny edge detection.
   
**Solution**: Python

### Project 2: Advanced Lane Finding(Computer Vision) 
   
**Summary**: Detect highway lanes from video using camera calibration, color conversion, sliding windows, and more.
   
**Solution**: Python

### Project 3: Traffic Sign Classifier(Deep Learning)
   
**Summary**: Build a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to determine traffic signs from the German traffic sign dataset.

**Solution**: Python, TensorFlow

### Project 4: Behavioural Cloning(Deep Learning)

**Summary**: Build and train a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) using Keras' library to control the car driving on the track.
   
**Solution**: Python, Keras

### Project 5: Extended Kalman Filters(Sensor Fusion)

**Summary**: Write a Kalman filter in C ++. Estimate position using sensor fusion of LiDAR and RADAR measurements.
   
**Solution**: C++

## Term 2: Localization, Path Planning, Control, and System Integration

### Project 6: Kidnapped Vehicle (Localisation)

**Summary**: Use a particle filter to identify cars relative to the world.
   
**Solution**: C++

### Project 7: Highway Driving(Path Planning)

**Summary**:Use sensor fusion data to drive your car on the highway and set requirements such as speed, acceleration, jerk, and distance you can safely drive the car. Make sure that the car can travel smoothly and safely on the track.

**Solution**: C++

### Project 8: PID Controller(Control)

**Summary**: Write a PID controller in C ++. Make sure the car can drive the truck. However, the tires do not leave the driveable area of the track surface.
   
**Solution**: C++

### Final Project: Program an Autonomous Vehicle

**Summary**: Complete the simulation to make sure the car can drive the truck, then place the code on the real self-driving car
