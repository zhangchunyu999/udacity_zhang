    "### Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. \n",
    "First, I converted the images to grayscale with the function of 'cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)'\n",
    "![alt text][image1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, I converted the images to edges with Canny Edge Detection.I used the function of 'cv2.Canny()'\n",
    "![alt text][image2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, in order to pull only the lane lines out of the image, I masked out a region of interest in the image with the function of 'cv2.fillPoly()'\n",
    "![alt text][image3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourth, I implemented the Hough Transform on edge detected images with the function of 'cv2.HoughLinesP()', then drew the line on the images.In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function,    \n",
    "![alt text][image4]\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I copy the line onto the original image to make my current pipeline as the following image.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image5]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "One potential shortcoming would be what would happen when the car is passing the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another shortcoming is that the precision of my current pipeline is not good enough, when the point apex of the mask is not on the white lane line.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "A possible improvement would be to write the current pipeline with the method of Least squares.\n",
    " \n",
    "Another potential improvement could be to use what other method to instead of 'masking out a region of interest' what was taught in this section. \n"
